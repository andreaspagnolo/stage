Report:
I expect the metrics to get worse as more rows changed. This happened with all the metrics except Entropy which always remains constantIn particular, the Silhouette worsens as the number of modified lines increases, but I expected a more evident deterioration.Gap statistic instead worsens as we expected, but has a slightly irregular trend.
